    <h3>The story so far:</h3>
        <p>After spending the early half of my twenties managing and touring in bands, the 2020 global pandemic put alot of things in perspective for me. The most crucial discovery was that a gig based lifestyle was longer a viable option for sustenance. After witnessing the music industry go belly up I realized that it was time to pursue becoming profficient in soemthing more practical and it was then that a friend of mine suggested trying out the Flatiron School coding bootcamp. </p>
